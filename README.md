# Heart Disease Prediction

This project is a machine learning application that predicts the presence of heart disease based on patient data. It uses various classification algorithms to analyze medical attributes and determine the likelihood of a heart condition.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Type:** Supervised Learning
- **Goal:** Binary classification (Heart Disease: Yes/No)
- **Input:** Patient data (e.g., age, cholesterol, chest pain type)
- **Output:** Prediction of heart disease presence (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
