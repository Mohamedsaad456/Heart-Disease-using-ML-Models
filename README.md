# Heart-Disease-using-ML-Models
This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing patient medical data, the model aims to classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease or not. It helps demonstrate how data science can assist in early diagnosis and healthcare decision-making.
